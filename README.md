# Bookify

This is a book review and rating website where anyone can post their thoughts about the books that they like. We have a robust user system which allows anyone to easily create an account. We also have a search function to search through the vast list of books. Functionalities yet to be implemented in the frontend-
1.Liking reviews
2.Sorting by category
3.Adding coverimages to books
While our project isn't completed yet we are still proud of our current version of the project.

## How it Works ?

1. The backend works on firebase. We create collections for various data, for eg: book collection, review collection.
2. The frontend works on react. We access the database through the api endpoints.
3. The global state is managed by redux.
